# Migraine Project

_This project is a website dedicated to the collection and presentation of information about migraines. The site features several sections: a home page, a detailed information section about migraines, and a tracking section which includes a form for recording details of migraine episodes such as the date, hours of sleep, physical activity performed, and weather conditions. In addition, the site presents a Leaflet map showing the regions of the world with the highest prevalence of migraines._
